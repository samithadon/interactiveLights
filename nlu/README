README

To run the app, you need to have nodejs installed. 
In Terminal, cd to this project folder’s directory, then type in Terminal: node app.js

Getting Started with creating an app to connect with NLU service
1. Install nodejs and Sublime
2. Sign up for IBM Bluemix Account (30 days trial), create a Natural Language Understanding Service and copy down the username and password from Service Credentials
3. Create a separate project folder
4. Create a .js file as main .js file for editing the app (you can call it app.js)
5. In Terminal, cd to the project folder
6. Still in Terminal, to create package.json file, type: npm init , ensure that app.js is under ‘main’ for the package.json
7. To save Watson module as a dependency, type: npm install watson-developer-cloud --save
8. Refer to this API reference to get examples
